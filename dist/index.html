The street is known for its theaters, especially near the intersection with Broadway at Times Square, and as such is also the name of the region of the theater district (and, at times, the red-light district) near that intersection</p>

                  <p class= "blur-for-accordian-text">The Empire State Building is a 102-story[c] Art Deco skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was designed by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon and completed in 1931. The building has a roof height of 1,250 feet (380 m) and stands a total of 1,454 feet (443.2 m) tall, including its antenna. Its name is derived from "Empire State", the nickname of New York. The Empire State Building stood as the world's tallest building for nearly 40 years until the construction of the World Trade Center's North Tower in Lower Manhattan in late 1970.</p>

                  <p class= "blur-for-accordian-text">The Flatiron Building, originally the Fuller Building,[A] is a triangular 22-story,[5] 285-foot (86.9 m) tall steel-framed landmarked building located at 175 Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron District neighborhood of the borough of Manhattan, New York City. Upon completion in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city at 20 floors high[6] and one of only two "skyscrapers" north of 14th Street – the other being the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, one block east. The building sits on a triangular block formed by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, and East 22nd Street – where the building's 87-foot (27 m) back end is located – with East 23rd Street grazing the triangle's northern (uptown) peak. As with numerous other wedge-shaped buildings, the name "Flatiron" derives from its resemblance to a cast-iron clothes iron.[7]</p>
